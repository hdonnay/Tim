Tim (Timer Script)
==================

Description
-----------
Terminal countdown timer with several modes written in POSIX shell script.
Currently Tim got a countdown timer, interval timer, pomodoro timer and magical
powers.

Usage
-----
It's really easy to play with Tim. Just run the script!

    ./tim h

Configuration
-------------
Read the file **timrc.example** for more information.

Dependencies
------------
You need to have a POSIX-compliant shell installed to run this.

When using the default settings, Tim can use:

- Mac OS X:
  - **afplay** - Comes with Mac OS X.
- GNU/Linux:
  - **aplay** - Comes with alsa-utils.
  - **mplayer** - The linux media player.

Tips
----
If you use Mac OS X you can put this in ~/.timrc to make it speak:

    WORK_CMD="say start working now"
    BREAK_CMD="say take a little break"
    POMODORO_CMD="say working session is over. take a break"

If you are sick of life you could try out this:

    TIMER_CMD="sudo rm -rf /"

Or if you need to celebrate after a pomodoro session:

    POMODORO_CMD="open rick-roll.avi"    # Mac OS X
    POMODORO_CMD="mplayer rick-roll.avi" # GNU/Linux
